Web Search and Instagram Screenshot Design

This program utilizes a module called 'time'. This makes the program wait a specified 
amount of time for the webpage to load before trying to click something on the page that hasn't loaded yet.

The other module I used was the selenium module to control the webbrowser. Using this, I can type in text, click
links, load pages and take a screenshot. There's a lot you can do with this module.

When you run the program in IDLE, it will open a Firefox browser.

The browser opens to Google's homepage with the search bar empty.

The phrase 'fox 35 news instagram' is then typed into the search bar and the 'Enter' button is clicked
to execute the search.

The program then holds for 5 seconds to allow the resulting search enough time to fully load.

I then have the program clicking on the link that matches 'https://www.instagram.com'

The program holds for another 5 seconds as Fox 35's Instagram page is loaded.

Then a full page screenshot is taken of the Instagram page showing all the photos. 
It is saved as 'screenshot_photos.png' in the current working folder.

The browser then closes and in the command shell, I tell the user that their screenshot has been saved.
