# Instructions for Running my Project

Elise Harper Final Project
Web Navigation

1. Make sure your device is connected to the Internet and that you have Firefox installed. You can download Firefox for free from here: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=Brand-US-GGL-Exact&utm_term=install%20firefox&gclid=CjwKEAjwgPe4BRCB66GG8PO69QkSJAC4EhHhTxavg5TfY3Zs7DRpkAoWeMyvnKp2dQ7xWq0EO8sWThoCgEjw_wcB
2. Make sure you have installed the Selenium module
3. Open the file 'EHFinal_Project' in IDLE
4. Run the file by pressing F5
5. The program should open Google's homepage in Firefox. Note- this may take a few seconds to complete...please be patient while it loads!
6. The search field will auto-fill with the term 'Fox 35 News Instagram' and bring up the resulting search.
7. The program will hold on the search page for 5 seconds to allow everything to load then it will click the link to Fox 35's Instagram page.
8. The Instagram page will load and a screenshot will be taken. The program will hold for 5 seconds before closing the browser.
9. To view the screenshot look for a file named "screenshot_photos.png" in your current working directory on your computer.
10. If you do not see a file named that, make sure you're searching all files and not just Python files in order to bring up the .png


Replace this text with the instructions your classmates will need to run your project. If your code needs any libraries using `pip` or any other tool, those instructions should be here as well. A complete stranger should be able to follow these instructions, so don't be afraid to include videos, screenshots, diagrams, text, whatever helps!
